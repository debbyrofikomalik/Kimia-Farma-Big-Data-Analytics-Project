# Kimia Farma Big Data Analytics Project

## 🚀 Overview
This project, conducted as part of the Project-Based Internship (PBI) by Rakamin Academy in collaboration with Kimia Farma, aims to deliver key Big Data Analytics insights to improve sales performance and support strategic decision-making in the pharmaceutical sector.  
Using real-world Kimia Farma sales data, the project transforms raw and fragmented datasets into actionable business intelligence, culminating in a dynamic and interactive sales dashboard.

## 📊 Project Highlights
- Executed comprehensive data sanity checks in **BigQuery**, assessing duplicates and missing values.  
- Integrated and aggregated multiple datasets (`kf_final_transaction`, `kf_products`, `kf_kantor_cabang`) to build a robust, analysis-ready dataset.  
- Conducted second-round data validation in **Python** using descriptive statistics, histograms, and boxplots to detect irregularities and potential outliers.  
- Designed and deployed an interactive **Looker Studio** dashboard to translate complex datasets into clear and actionable business insights.
